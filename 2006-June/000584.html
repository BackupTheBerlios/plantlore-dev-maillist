Date: 2006-06-05 22:10:47 +0200 (Mon, 05 Jun 2006)
New Revision: 454

Modified:
   trunk/src/net/sf/plantlore/middleware/DBLayer.java
   trunk/src/net/sf/plantlore/server/HibernateDBLayer.java
Log:
Add executeInsertInTransactionHistory() method to DBLayer. This method executes INSERT query using long running transaction without saving history records.
