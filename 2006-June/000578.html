<PRE>Bug #7760, was updated on 2006-Jun-05 17:53
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Plantlore
Category: Overview
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: Bug
Priority: 5
Submitted by: tkovarik
Assigned to : fraktalek
Summary: Previous selection is not cleared when searching

Details: When you select some records in the overview and then search for occurrences, previous selection is not cleared and it is possible to delete selected records (although you do not see them). Furthermore, buttons used for selecting all records, no recordsa and for inverting selection cause NullPointerException to be throws.

How to reproduce:
1. Open Plantlore, login (overview is diaplayed)
2. Select some records (check the checkboxes)
3. Open search dialog, search for something that is not in the database (so that no records are found)
4A. Now overview doesn't display anything, click Delete button. System allows you to delete previously selected records
4B. Click &quot;Invert selection&quot;, &quot;Select all&quot; or &quot;Select none&quot; buttons. NPE is thrown.

Although the behaviour described in 4A might be a feature, I think it should not.

Comment:
This could be a feature in the future (if properly fixed of course). The user could make different searches and checked records would be remembered even after consecutive searches. Would have to fix invert selected though... And perhaps change select all to select all on current page, the same for select none and add functions to select and deselect the whole result...
So right now we'll agreed to fix this bug by always clearing selection when and where apropriate.
