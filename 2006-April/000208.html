# Lada, 
2 things. Ive modified the dbmod_firebird again, but I dont expect #
it to be the solution. 
but I would be interested to know if its the same # with this 
module. 

The other thing is I dont have a unicode firebird # database here 
myself. would you mind to send me an extract of yours? just a # 
single table with some unicode records would be enough to test it 
here. 

Thanks,

Hello # Markus, 

thank you very much for your quick answer. 

I # replaced the existing script &quot;dbmod_firebird.py&quot; with the one 
from your email, # but it didn't help. 
I also executed script &quot;test.py&quot;, you can find the # screenshot with
the result in the attachment. 

Lada

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Lada, 
</I>I will # try to trace the errors. As you said already they dont &gt; 
look as if they have # anything in common. 
The UTF8 problem you are having &gt; is very likely # caused by the 
firebird connection. The Firebird module is not &gt; being used much, #
so its quite likely that you discover errors noone has seen so &gt; 
far. 

I have changed the firebird module slightly. Please try the &gt; 
attached # dbmod by replacing the existing one in your installation 
&gt;<i> # (lib/biocase/wrapper/dbmod). 
</I>
If this doesnt help, try to execute &gt; # the attached script from the
commandline and send me a screenshot from the &gt; # result. It tries 
to connect to firebird differently and get some results to the # &gt; 
terminal. Id like to know what encoding those strings have. But 
first you will # &gt; have to modify the script to insert your db 
connection and some simple SQL &gt; # select to get some unicode data 
from your database. If you need help please let # &gt; me know. 

regards,

Betreff: BioCASE # &gt; Provider Software - character encoding 

Hello, 

we # are a &gt; group of developers working on an open-source project 
Plantlore &gt; # (<A HREF="http://plantlore.berlios.de">http://plantlore.berlios.de</A> &gt; # &lt;<A HREF="http://email.seznam.">http://email.seznam.</A>
cz/redir?<A HREF="http://plantlore.berlios.de">http://plantlore.berlios.de</A>&gt; ). We are using &gt; # BioCASE 
Provider Software (BPS) as part of the project and we have 
encountered a # &gt; problem with character encoding we are unable to 
solve. From what we can say, # &gt; the problem is in the BPS therefore
we reported it some time ago but &gt; # unfortunately didn't receive 
any reply yet. 

In the previous email # &gt; we have reported a problem with wrong 
character encoding when displaying data # on &gt; the web pages. 
Special characters (Czech as well as e.g. German, such as &#283;, # &#353;, &gt; 
&#369;) are not correctly displayed. Please see attached screenshots for 
more &gt; # information. 

We think we have ruled out all the reasons on our &gt; # side: 
* For data in the database we use UNICODE_FSS encoding (we are # 
using &gt; Firebird 1.5). 
* We have set UTF8 in the database connection # settings &gt; according
to the BPS documentation 
* The web page where the # problem occurs &gt; is using UTF8 encoding 

Furthermore, here are more # details of our &gt; configuration: 
* Database: Firebird 1.5 
* Python: # We have tried &gt; versions 2.3 and 2.4 (those recommended 
by the 
documentation) without any &gt; luck 
* We have tested it on Windows and # Linux platforms 

We &gt; are following the BioCASE development and we # have tried new 
version 2.4.0 &gt; released recently. Unfortunately, we were not # able
to test our problem since we &gt; couldn't even use the training 
database for # Firebird 
/&gt;(trainingDB_firebird.gdb) provided with the release. The error # 
occurred when &gt; doing &quot;Scan request&quot;. In the attachment you can find
detailed # description. This &gt; is most probably completely different
issue from the # previous one though. 
/&gt;We had some problems with connection to Firebird # database 
previously (August &gt; 2005) but were successfully solved by Markus # 
D&#246;ring (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/plantlore-dev">m.doering at BGBM.org</A> &gt; # &lt;<A HREF="http://email.seznam.cz/">http://email.seznam.cz/</A>

&gt;<i> # &gt; ). 
</I>
We would like to ask you for a comment on these issues. We # know &gt; 
it is still possible that the problem is on our end, but it would 
help us # to &gt; know where to look for it. Since we would like to 
release Plantlore in the # very &gt; near future, prompt help will be 
appreciated. 

If you need # any more &gt; information about these problems, feel free
to contact us. 

Thank &gt; you very much in advance 

On behalf of Plantlore # development &gt; team 

Lada Oberreiterova
